# Setup: RStudio Shortcuts

*Purpose*: Your ability to get stuff done is highly dependent on your fluency
with your tools. One aspect of fluency is knowing and *using* keyboard
shortcuts. In this exercise, we'll go over some of the most important ones.

*Reading*: [Keyboard
shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts); [Code Chunk Options](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)
*Note*: Use this reading to look up answers to the questions below. Rather than
*memorizing* this information, I recommend you download a
[cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf),
and either print it out or save it in a convenient place on your computer. Get
used to referencing your cheatsheets while doing data science---practice makes
perfect!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### __q1__ What do the following keyboard shortcuts do?

* Within the script editor or a chunk

    * `Alt` + `-`
Inserts assignment operator <-

    * `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `M`
Inserts pipe operator %>% 

    * `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter`
If no text is highlighted, runs complete expression that cursor is on, and advances to the next line. If text is highlighted, runs selected text.

    * `F1` (Note: on a Mac you need to press `fn` + `F1`)
If cursor is on a function name, pulls up the help page for the function.

	* `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `C`
Comments/uncomments the code at the cursor, or highlighted code.


* Within R Markdown

    * `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`
Inserts chunk

* Within a chunk

    * `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter`
Runs current chunk

    * `Ctrl` + `I` (`Cmd` + `I`)
Re-indents selected lines


Try this below!

```{r}
## Re-indent these lines
c(
  "foo",
  "bar",
  "goo",
  "gah"
)
```


### __q2__ For a chunk, what header option do you use to

* Run the code, don't display it, but show its results?
```{r echo=FALSE}
```

* Run the code, but don't display it or its results?
```{r include=FALSE}
```

### __q3__ How do stop the code in a chunk from running once it has started?

Click the red square in the top right corner of the chunk.

### __q4__ How do you show the "Document Outline" in RStudio?

*Hint*: Try googling "rstudio document outline"

`Ctrl + Shift + O`
