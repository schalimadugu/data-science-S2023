*Purpose*: We've been learning how to quantify uncertainty in estimates through the exercises; now its time to put those skills to use studying real data. In this challenge we'll use concepts like confidence intervals to help us make sense of census data.

*Reading*: - [Using ACS Estimates and Margin of Error](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/guidance/training-presentations/acs-moe.html) (Optional) - [Patterns and Causes of Uncertainty in the American Community Survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622813002518?casa_token=VddzQ1-spHMAAAAA:FTq92LXgiPVloJUVjnHs8Ma1HwvPigisAYtzfqaGbbRRwoknNq56Y2IzszmGgIGH4JAPzQN0) (Optional, particularly the *Uncertainty in surveys* section under the Introduction.)

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

## Due Date

<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight** before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true) for more information.

# Setup

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

### **q1** Load the population data from c06; simply replace `filename_pop` below.

```{r q1-task}
## TODO: Give the filename for your copy of Table B01003
filename_pop <- "./data/ACSDT5Y2018.B01003-Data.csv"

## NOTE: No need to edit
df_pop <-
  read_csv(
    filename_pop,
    skip = 2,
    col_names = c(
      "id",
      "geographic_area_name",
      "population_estimate",
      "population_moe"
    )
  )
```

You might wonder why the `Margin of Error` in the population estimates is listed as `*****`. From the [documentation (PDF link)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj81Omy16TrAhXsguAKHTzKDQEQFjABegQIBxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.census.gov%2Fprograms-surveys%2Facs%2Ftech_docs%2Faccuracy%2FMultiyearACSAccuracyofData2018.pdf%3F&usg=AOvVaw2TOrVuBDlkDI2gde6ugce_) for the ACS:

> If the margin of error is displayed as '\*\*\*\*\*' (five asterisks), the estimate has been controlled to be equal to a fixed value and so it has no sampling error. A standard error of zero should be used for these controlled estimates when completing calculations, such as those in the following section.

This means that for cases listed as `*****` the US Census Bureau recommends treating the margin of error (and thus standard error) as zero.

### **q2** Obtain median income data from the Census Bureau:

-   `Filter > Topics > Income and Poverty > Income and Poverty`
-   `Filter > Geography > County > All counties in United States`
-   Look for `Median Income in the Past 12 Months` (Table S1903)
-   Download the 2018 5-year ACS estimates; save to your `data` folder and add the filename below.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Give the filename for your copy of Table S1903
filename_income <- "./data/ACSST5Y2018.S1903-Data.csv"

## NOTE: No need to edit
df_income <-
  read_csv(filename_income, skip = 1) %>% 
  rename("id" = "Geography") %>% 
  select(
    -starts_with("Annotation of Margin of Error"),
    -starts_with("Annotation of Estimate")
  )

df_income
```

Use the following test to check that you downloaded the correct file:

```{r q2-tests}
## NOTE: No need to edit, use to check you got the right file.
assertthat::assert_that(
  df_income %>%
    filter(id == "0500000US01001") %>%
    pull(`Estimate!!Percent Distribution!!FAMILY INCOME BY FAMILY SIZE!!2-person families`)
  == 45.6
)

print("Well done!")
```

This dataset is in desperate need of some *tidying*. To simplify the task, we'll start by considering the `\\d-person families` columns first.

### **q3** Tidy the `df_income` dataset by completing the code below. Pivot and rename the columns to arrive at the column names `id, geographic_area_name, category, income_estimate, income_moe`.

*Hint*: You can do this in a single pivot using the `".value"` argument and a `names_pattern` using capture groups `"()"`. Remember that you can use an OR operator `|` in a regex to allow for multiple possibilities in a capture group, for example `"(Estimate|Margin of Error)"`.

```{r q3-task}
df_q3 <-
  df_income %>%
  select(
    id,
    contains("Geographic"),
    contains("median") & matches("\\d-person families")
  ) %>%
  mutate(across(contains("median"), as.numeric)) %>%
## TODO: Pivot the data, rename the columns
  pivot_longer(
    names_pattern = "(Estimate|Margin of Error).*(\\d-person families)",
    names_to = c(".value", 'category'),
    cols = c(-id, -contains("Geographic"))
  ) %>% 
  rename("geographic_area_name" = "Geographic Area Name",
         "income_estimate" = "Estimate", 
         "income_moe" = "Margin of Error" )

df_q3
```

Use the following tests to check your work:

```{r q3-tests}
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q3),
  c("id", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe")
))

assertthat::assert_that(
  df_q3 %>%
    filter(id == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_moe)
  == 6663
)

print("Nice!")
```

The data gives finite values for the Margin of Error, which is closely related to the Standard Error. The Census Bureau documentation gives the following relationship between Margin of Error and Standard Error:

$$\text{MOE} = 1.645 \times \text{SE}.$$

### **q4** Convert the margin of error to standard error. Additionally, compute a 99% confidence interval on income, and normalize the standard error to `income_CV = income_SE / income_estimate`. Provide these columns with the names `income_SE, income_lo, income_hi, income_CV`.

```{r q4-task}
df_q4 <- df_q3 %>% 
  mutate(income_SE = income_moe/1.645) %>% 
  mutate(income_lo = income_estimate - income_SE*2.576) %>% # Multiply by z value
  mutate(income_hi = income_estimate + income_SE*2.576) %>% 
  mutate(income_CV = income_SE/income_estimate)

df_q4
```

Use the following tests to check your work:

```{r q4-tests}
## NOTE: No need to edit
assertthat::assert_that(setequal(
  names(df_q4),
  c("id", "geographic_area_name", "category", "income_estimate", "income_moe",
    "income_SE", "income_lo", "income_hi", "income_CV")
))

assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(id == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_SE) - 4050.456
  ) / 4050.456 < 1e-3
)

assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(id == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_lo) - 54513.72
  ) / 54513.72 < 1e-3
)

assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(id == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_hi) - 75380.28
  ) / 75380.28 < 1e-3
)

assertthat::assert_that(
  abs(
    df_q4 %>%
    filter(id == "0500000US01001", category == "2-person families") %>%
    pull(income_CV) - 0.06236556
  ) / 0.06236556 < 1e-3
)

print("Nice!")
```

One last wrangling step: We need to join the two datasets so we can compare population with income.

### **q5** Join `df_q4` and `df_pop`.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Join df_q4 and df_pop by the appropriate column
df_data <- df_q4 %>%
  left_join(
    df_pop,
    by = "id"
  ) %>% 
  rename("geographic_area_name" = "geographic_area_name.x") %>% 
  select(
    -starts_with("geographic_area_name.y"),
  )

df_data
```

# Analysis

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

We now have both estimates and confidence intervals for `\\d-person families`. Now we can compare cases with quantified uncertainties: Let's practice!

### **q6** Study the following graph, making sure to note what you can *and can't* conclude based on the estimates and confidence intervals. Document your observations below and answer the questions.

```{r q6-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
wid <- 0.5

df_data %>%
  filter(str_detect(geographic_area_name, "Massachusetts")) %>%
  mutate(
    county = str_remove(geographic_area_name, " County,.*$"),
    county = fct_reorder(county, income_estimate)
  ) %>%

  ggplot(aes(county, income_estimate, color = category)) +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = income_lo, ymax = income_hi),
    position = position_dodge(width = wid)
  ) +
  geom_point(position = position_dodge(width = wid)) +

  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "County",
    y = "Median Household Income"
  )
```

**Observations**:

-   Document your observations here.
    -   2-person families tend to have lower household incomes.
    -   In most cases, 2-person families have smaller confidence intervals than those of 6-person families.
    -   It appears as though the household income is higher if there are more people in the family, though this is not necessarily always true.
-   Can you confidently distinguish between household incomes in Suffolk county? Why or why not?
    -   No, since the household incomes are very similar and the error bars overlap.
-   Which counties have the widest confidence intervals?
    -   Nantucket and Dukes have the widest intervals.

In the next task you'll investigate the relationship between population and uncertainty.

### **q7** Plot the standard error against population for all counties. Create a visual that effectively highlights the trends in the data. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint*: Remember that standard error is a function of *both* variability (e.g. variance) and sample size.

```{r q7-task}
df_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(population_estimate, income_SE, color = category)) +
  geom_point()
```

**Observations**:

-   What *overall* trend do you see between `SE` and population? Why might this trend exist?
    -   Overall, the standard error decreases as the population increases, which makes sense since a larger set of data that is closer to the true population number will generally yield smaller error.
-   What does this *overall* trend tell you about the relative ease of studying small vs large counties?
    -   It would probably be easier to study large counties, since it might be easier to find a more representative sample of the county without having to choose the population or a large part of it.

# Going Further

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

Now it's your turn! You have income data for every county in the United States: Pose your own question and try to answer it with the data.

### **q8** Pose your own question about the data. Create a visualization (or table) here, and document your observations.

```{r q8-task}
## TODO: Pose and answer your own question about the data
# How does family size relate to median income in counties around the United States?
df_data %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = category, y = income_estimate)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

**Observations**:

-   The 4-person families have the highest median income, while the 2-person families have the lowest median income.
-   The interquartile range is greater for larger families.

Ideas:

-   Compare trends across counties that are relevant to you; e.g. places you've lived, places you've been, places in the US that are interesting to you.
-   In q3 we tidied the median `\\d-person families` columns only.
    -   Tidy the other median columns to learn about other people groups.
    -   Tidy the percentage columns to learn about how many households of each category are in each county.
-   Your own idea!
